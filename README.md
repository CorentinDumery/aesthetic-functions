### Aesthetic 2D visualization of functions

Work in Progress.

The objective of this project is to explore the depths of two-dimensional mathematics. To put it simply, it is about visualizing a function in 2D, but with fancy colors and some extra options. It is not very useful, but I like it. If you're interested, I'd be delighted to see your creations and exchange tips !
